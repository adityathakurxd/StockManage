## ABSTRACT

**

This document is meant for describing all the features and procedures that were followed while developing the system.

This document specially mentions the details of the project, how it was developed, the primary requirement, as well as various features and functionalities of the project and the procedures followed in achieving these objectives.

Stock Management System is software which is helpful for the businesses that operate stores, where the store owner keeps the records of purchase. This project eliminates the paperwork, human faults, manual delay and speeds up the process.

Stock Management System will have the ability to track overall worth and available stock. This is simple, fast and intelligent Stock management that can be used by anyone.

With effective use, any Institute can apply the “Stock Management System” for management of stock and tracking inventory items better in less time.

**INTRODUCTION**

Stock Management System is software developed for small businesses and freelancers to keep a record of every product. It facilitates access to the Stock Information of a particular product in a particular company. Information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the employee for the available product. This is used to show how much Stock a company is having at one time and also all the details of every product.

**PURPOSE**

The purpose of developing the Stock Management System is to computerize the traditional way of maintaining Stock. Another purpose for developing this software is to calculate the final price (included GST) of a product automatically.

**SCOPE**

It will work for a particular organization. This project now can run only on a specific platform but later can be made as an application to operate it Online.

**PRODUCT PROFILE**

Product Information: product_name, product_quantity, product_price.

**CUSTOMER PROFILE**

Customer Personal Information: Full name, Email ID, Phone Number, Gender, Address, State.

**TIME MANAGEMENT**

This project eliminates the paperwork, human faults, manual delay and thus speeds up the process. It reduces the risk as manual calculation sometimes goes wrong and also is very time consuming.

The benefits of using a Time and Stock Management System at a workplace cannot be underestimated. As there are multiple products of different companies in a Shop, the need of an efficient organized system is getting more and more vital. Therefore, there are many companies (like Shipcom, Pelton…) implementing Time Management solutions in order to improve productivity.

Stock Management System reduces the space needed to store products, calculation of price becomes easy as for workers maintaining a store becomes difficult if there is no owner as they don’t know the prices.

The program is easy to use, great help for stores because it is a difficult task to manage stock and calculate the price and it’s well suited for any organization that needs to manage the Stock.

The most important thing about this project is that one can manage Stock by doing operations add and remove so that the person will be notified when to get the new Stock into the store.

## OBJECTIVE:

-   To create a Stock Management system that is to be used in the place of maintaining thick records using pen-paper method.
    
-   A high-end secured system that is more reliable, feasible and user friendly.
    
-   Use of JAVA programming language and MySQL server technology to create strong and secured database connectivity.

## SCOPE:

The project is developed as a desktop application and it will work for a particular institute or organization. But later on the project can be modified to operate it online.

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENT STUDY:

**USER CHARACTERISTICS**

Stock Management System is software which is helpful for the businesses that operate stores,where the store owner keeps the records of purchase. This project eliminates the paperwork, human faults, manual delay and speeds up the process.

**EXISTING SYSTEM:**

1. Manual calculation of stock present in any store is time-consuming and very risky.

2. The workers cannot maintain the store when there is no owner as they do not know

the prices.

**PROPOSED SYSTEM:**

The proposed system is a JAVA application, it is better than existing system because of

following reasons:

-   Overall worth of stock, products can be viewed by the owner.
    
-   Prices of stock present in the store can be seen so that workers can also manage the stock
    
-   without the presence of the owner.
    
-   It doesn’t require manpower, so it is not expensive.
    

**SYSTEM REQUIREMENT**

*Hardware:*

Ø  Corei5.

Ø  1GB Hard Disk Space.

Ø  4 GB RAM.

*Software:*

Ø  Operating System: Windows 10
 
Ø  Front End: Apache Neatbeans 11.3

Ø  Back End: MS SQL SERVER

# SYSTEM ANALYSIS

## STUDY AND WEAKNESS OF CURRENT SYSTEM

  

Current System:

The current system of stock management is still rooted in the ancient formula of maintaining thick records. Every day after sale, the shopkeeper calculates the number of sold goods and number of goods left in stock. The task of maintaining records in this way is a tedious one. Also when the shopkeeper is not at the shop and something is sold, it makes it difficult to maintain the stock. Moreover there is no accuracy in the stock management.

Weakness of current system:

-   ### Not User Friendly:
    

The way of maintaining thick records is tedious task. Being less user friendly guarantees no accuracy. Moreover this process is very slow and demands time.

-   ### Difficulty :
    

The ancient method is very difficult, time consuming and quite irritating. A shop has hundreds of varieties; maintaining stocks of these items on a regular basis becomes more difficult.

-   ### Manual Control:
    

Machines are somehow more accurate in terms of calculation than humans. Traditional method of stock management opts for manual control that increases the chance of errors.

-   ### Time Consuming:
    

Manual calculations requires concentration and time to its fullest thus the stock management becomes tiresome and time consuming.

-   ### Lots of Registers of Different Titles:
    

Papers are the prime requirement of this way of stock management. Shopkeepers employ different registers for different varieties which is not convincing.

  

# REQUIREMENTS OF NEW SYSTEM

## USER REQUIREMENTS

The project emphasises to be efficient and friendly for users.

-   This software maintains the stock itself by just one action from the user.
    
-   It saves time for the user and helps him get rid of the traditional tedious task of stock management.
    
-   This is more accurate and hence reduces the risk of manual errors.
    
-   It is cost effective and is pocket friendly for the user.
    
-   It helps get rid of all thick registers thus there is no need to purchase registers thereby money is saved
    
-   No papers means environment friendly.
    
-   Finally it is designed according to the needs of the user hence it is much better than current system.
    

  

## FEASIBILITY STUDY

The study is based on operational, technical, economic, and time factors. The purpose of the study is to determine if the S.T.A.R Stock Management System request should proceed further.

  

**1. Economically Feasibility:**

S.T.A.R Stock Management System  has been developed with respect to Business point of view. It is capable of maintaining the stock records of a small general purpose store, working on the ground level and even big industries like MNCs. Since the proposed system is one time investment of money, it eliminates the cost of buying record books every time. Moreover the high risk of error is reduced and the method is environmentally friendly.

**2. Technical feasibility:**

S.T.A.R is technically feasible. The system has the ability to track available stock and overall worth by just one click of the user. Thus the system reduces human faults, manual delay and speeds up the process. The user does not require any other additional Hardware and software.

**3. Behavioural Feasibility:**

S.T.A.R is designed according to the needs of the user. The system is quite simple and attractive. User just needs to enter the required details and create a login Id. Features like Add pane, Delete pane, Update pane and Modify pane enables the user to add, delete, modify and update the stock entries.

No special training is required for operating the system.

## FEATURES OF NEW SYSTEM

The Stock Management System has been designed in such a way that it fulfills the following requirements of the user:-

### 1. User Friendly: -

The new system is user friendly because entering, storing and extracting data is done by just one action from the user. A login page is provided through which users can securely access the system. Hence, the privacy of the user is protected.

### 2. Stocks are easily maintained:-

Stocks can be easily maintained in the new system as per the requirement of the user. Users can track the quantity of sold goods and left one and can order required goods in advance.

### 3. Very less paperwork:

The new system eliminates the drudging pen-paper method of keeping and maintaining records. All the stock entries are feted into the system and the records can be generated anytime according to the requirement of the user. Moreover work becomes easy as there is no risk of error.

### 4. Computer operator control:

Computer operator control is there so manual calculation of number of sold goods and left goods is not required. Furthermore, maintaining the stocks of various varieties can be done on a regular basis. So work can be done speedily and in time.
